want data. have data. will collect data.  

assumption: in this course, you are here to work with data.
data literacy IS data science.

<b> Philosophy of R stats </b>  

Statistical thinking: likelihood, error, and effect sizes. Contemporary statisticians embrace and are mindful of these three key concepts in all research, data, and statistical inference examinations.

Modes of inference with your data: using data, what can you infer or do?
1. Data description
2. Likelihood
3. Estimation
4. Baysian inference - weight and include what we know
5. Prediction
6. Hypothesis testing
7. Decision making -balance gains and risks

This set of ideas provide the foundation for many data science and statistical approached to working with evidence within almost every domain of science.

<b>Data viz first and foremost. Case study #1.</b>
```{r, data viz exercise, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#blog post by Fisseha Berhane
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)

#Create four groups: setA, setB, setC and setD.
setA=select(anscombe, x=x1,y=y1)
setB=select(anscombe, x=x2,y=y2)
setC=select(anscombe, x=x3,y=y3)
setD=select(anscombe, x=x4,y=y4)

#Add a third column which can help us to identify the four groups.
setA$group ='SetA'
setB$group ='SetB'
setC$group ='SetC'
setD$group ='SetD'

#merge the four datasets
all_data=rbind(setA,setB,setC,setD)  # merging all the four data sets
all_data[c(1,13,23,43),]  # showing sample

#compare summary stats
summary_stats =all_data%>%group_by(group)%>%summarize("mean x"=mean(x),
                                       "Sample variance x"=var(x),
                                       "mean y"=round(mean(y),2),
                                       "Sample variance y"=round(var(y),1),
                                       'Correlation between x and y '=round(cor(x,y),2)
                                      )
models = all_data %>% 
      group_by(group) %>%
      do(mod = lm(y ~ x, data = .)) %>%
      do(data.frame(var = names(coef(.$mod)),
                    coef = round(coef(.$mod),2),
                    group = .$group)) %>%
dcast(., group~var, value.var = "coef")

summary_stats_and_linear_fit = cbind(summary_stats, data_frame("Linear regression" =
                                    paste0("y = ",models$"(Intercept)"," + ",models$x,"x")))

summary_stats_and_linear_fit

#data viz instead as first step
ggplot(all_data, aes(x=x,y=y)) +geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "red", fill = "orange", size = 3)+
    ggtitle("Anscombe's data sets")+geom_smooth(method = "lm",se = FALSE,color='blue') + 
    facet_wrap(~group, scales="free")

```

Outcome from stats first, data viz later (tricked), descriptive estimates of data can be deceptive. Draw first, then interpret.


<b>Survey data from class. Case study #2.</b>
```{r, survey, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#load class survey responses from google poll completed in class
survey<-read.csv("data/5081.survey.1.csv")
str(survey) #check data match what we collected

#data viz
hist(survey$r.experience, xlab="experience in R (1 is none, 5 is extensive)", ylab="frequency", main="Likert Scale 1 to 5")
plot(survey$r.experience~survey$discipline, xlab="discipline", ylab="experience in R")
plot(survey$r.studio, ylab="R Studio")
plot(survey$research.data, ylab="Research data")
#observe patterns by checking plots
```

<b>Observations from data viz</b>
We have limited experience in R. Experience in R varies by research discipline. A total of half the respondents have tried R Studio. Most participants will be working with quantitative data in their own research projects.

```{r, test survey data with EDA, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Now, try some simple summary statistics.
summary(survey)
#Data summary looks reasonable based on plots, mean R experience is < 2
t.test(survey$r.experience, mu=1) #t-test if mean is different from 1
t.test(survey$r.experience, mu=2) #t-test if mean is different from 2
#A one sample t-test confirms we have a bit experience in R.

m1<-glm(r.experience~discipline, family = poisson, data = survey) #test for differenes between disciplines in R experience
m1 #model summary
anova(m1, test="Chisq") #test whether the differences in model are different
#Too little evidence to be significantly different between disciplines.

```


**Case study #3.**  
```{r, text, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#install.packages("SMPracticals")
library(SMPracticals)
library(tidyverse)
darwin
data("darwin")
data <- darwin
data <- as_tibble(data)
data
ggplot(darwin, aes(type, height)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

**Case study #4.**  
```{r, 2018.data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("data/5081.survey.2.csv")
data
data <- na.exclude(data)
data

#crimping code from last time to compare the same way
hist(data$r.experience, xlab="experience in R (1 is none, 5 is extensive)", ylab="frequency", main="Likert Scale 1 to 5")

ggplot(data, aes(discipline, r.experience)) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(data, aes(r.studio)) +
  geom_bar()

ggplot(data, aes(research.data)) +
  geom_bar()

```


<b> Practical skill outcomes of R stats useful for competency test</b>  

Understand the difference between R and R Studio.  
Use scripts or R Markdown files to save all your work.  
Be prepared to share code.  
Load data, clean data, visualize data, then and only then begin applying statistics.  

Proximately: be able to use and work with dataframes, vectors, functions, tibbles, and libraries in R.
